# Base 
# Assighnment descirtption
 (Base 1) We had to make the base of our main part on Onshape

# Evidence
[Onshape Base](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/0dc868f01024a4760f7fa7c1/w/753fdc390cf1eb0e5034d3b8/e/0b81fd33856e36fcd8fad764)

# Reflection
1. I learned some new short cuts, like n for (normal)
2. Even though i messed up aq decent amount of times the more i did it the better I got
3. The cocept is easy to grasp onto, a lot easier that SolidWorks
4. At the end i was excited to say i was finished

# Mount
# Assighnment description
(Mount) I needed to make the mount using skectchs and shapes

# Evidence

# Reflection
1. I learned three new helpful ways to make parts
2. I got a little bit more used to using the shortcut skectches to speed up time
3. I struggled a little and i didn't have to keep on starting over
4. Everything is going smoothly and i's really enjoying it

# Fork
# Assighnment description
(Fork) I needed to create a fork for to go with my other projects

# Evidence
[Onshape Fork](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/76b2ceff23468508f91c636f/w/d216afd5436ed3ce7aafeb10/e/956ff08ca1fd39c31f6fe29f)

# Reflection
1. I learned more new shorcut tips such as mirror
2. I did mess up a little bit, more than others
3. Still progressing in a speedy way
4. I have more confidence in making the part

# Tire
# Assighnment description
(Tire) I needed to create a wheel using minimal instructions and features

# Evidence
[Onshape Tire](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/e23e01a588098a7d90326637/w/7c3c2022762d26baa6b6edd4/e/a1acf7f69c5b1f30584ed3cd)

# Reflection
1. The flow is better got this donr in around 5 minutes
2. Glad it got straight to the point and easy to follow instructions
3. Was excited to complete and notice my time increase
4. Completed in arounds five to seven steps

# Wheel
# Assignment description
 (Wheel) I needed to create a wheel using onshape and a helpful video
 
 # Evidence

 # Reflection
 1. I learned how to make a ciruler pattern to make it go a little faster
 2. Once I got over my road block it was a breeze
 3. Had the ability to multitask
 4. Used multiple fillets at once

# Axlecollarbearings
(Axlecollarbearings) I needed to make my last few peices before my sub assembly

# Reflection
1. I was able to easily combine and make diffrent pats
2. I learned how to make a part with two mintus
3. I was comfident I knew what I was doing
