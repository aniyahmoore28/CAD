# Reflection
1. I learned some new short cuts, like n for (normal)
2. Even though i messed up aq decent amount of times the more i did it the better I got
3. The cocept is easy to grasp onto, a lot easier that SolidWorks
4. At the end i was excited to say i was finished

# Reflection
1. I learned three new helpful ways to make parts
2. I got a little bit more used to using the shortcut skectches to speed up time
3. I struggled a little and i didn't have to keep on starting over
4. Everything is going smoothly and i's really enjoying it
